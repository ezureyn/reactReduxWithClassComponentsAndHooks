//In this project, state management is being done with redux.
//All files is being managed with redux
//in the other files except SecondPage we have used mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps

//In order to implement hooks we import useSelector and useDispatch

    //In summary shallowequal checks the array in order to prevent unneccessary re-render
    //In general redux store is not permanent, it has its own temproray memory 
    //unless we save our state in to local storage of browser, initialState will not change
    //so we will get the changes form reducers like below:
    const city=useSelector(state=>state.usersCityReducer, shallowEqual);
    const name=useSelector(state=>state.usersNameReducer, shallowEqual );
    //if we don't use redux, only use pure react we can reach the state as below:
    // const city=useSelector(state=>state.state.apiCity, shallowEqual);
    // const name=useSelector(state=>state.apiName, shallowEqual );
    //Because of using redux our states are our reducers.
    
    //Now we will get counter value from  counterReducer and update it with useState to our newCount variable
    //we could do that with using useDispatch and counter actions we wrote before like increment, decrement etc.
    //But this time we will get the state from CounterReducer with useSelector and
    //We will update the state via useState with any value that we will assign into a variable that we will name later as newCount.

    }

    //We will assign this to a variable and use it in jsx

    // with wrapping getDataFromAPIForCity with dispatch in the button below

    //In order to prevent page refresh, we will not use direct Link tags
    //We should avoid page refreshing because of state reset.
